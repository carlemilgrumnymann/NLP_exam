Therefore, the options B and J can be eliminated since they imply a lack of diversity. The question does not directly refer to an ice age or a subsequent drought, so options E, F, and H can also be eliminated. The remaining options A, C, D, G, I do not indicate whether the diversity is \"as of 2020\" or not, but the question asks for the state \"as of 2020\". Thus, none of the provided options clearly matches the question's specific requirements. However, option A, \"multiple hominid species but with limited diversity.\", is the most plausible answer based on current understanding of hominid evolution from the Middle Pliocene. But none of the provided options directly answers the question \"as of 2020\".\n",
