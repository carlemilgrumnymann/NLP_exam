Moreover, according to research from Ariel Rokem et al., even when you rest quietly without focusing your attention consciously anywhere specific during an fMRI scan-a method that eliminates almost entirely responses coming solely due to voluntary control by participants-, more than half the cortex still shows signals related primarily if not exclusively with blood flow patterns intrinsic to neuronal operations called resting state networks rather they have nothing specifically associated w/ attentional states nor sensory perceptions[ source NCBI article titled Functional Organization of Heterogeneous Cortical Tissue Revealed By Scalp EEG] . So while there certainly may be variations based upon individual differences as well age & disease effects among other factors, overall the idea put forth in media depictions showing someone gaining extraordinary intelligence through activating underutilized areas after somehow enhancing \"brain efficiency\" remains largely science fiction..As far as saving energy goes, since higher levels cognitive function consumes between five and twenty percent of total body oxygen consumption whereas basics like breathing account for thirty four %, one could argue indirect benefits via enhanced productivity leading eventually downstream lower food intake requirements etc...However direct comparisons regarding absolute quantity expended would depend also factoring many variables including exact amount processing demands along timing period considered(acute vs chronic considerations), type task being performed -complex vs simple mental activities consume different degrees physiological resources).\n"

This format allows diverse regions within the federation independence alongside inter-regional cooperation and collaboration on matters requiring collective action – this could contribute towards its long term sustainability if managed properly. Adapting flexible mechanisms which allow new member integration would also enhance survivability against territorial shifts, migration patterns & economic developments throughout various time periods.\n",

May patience persist amid attempts at speaking gently over time, hoping always finding room outside any expectations held by minds thinking beside mine in search but knowing learning makes space wide spaces without conclusions emptying making paused moments full questions continuing instead allowing movement towards wisdom sometimes recognizing limits alongside others looking ahead toward unknown futures sharing thanks with friends whose company reminds both of mutual vulnerability uncertain pathways forward offer some solace: naming opens doors softly wondering aloud holding conversations across distances reading attentively hearing voices responding sincere gratitude given & received reciprocity offers possibility and yet possibilities remain open leaving space for continued dialogue receptive hearts willing recognize interruptions continue questioning together: 'Thank You'.\n"
