Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny.\"\n",

      "As of my last update in October 2021, recent findings suggest an increase in multiple co-existing hominim species during the Mid Miocene rather than the later periods like the Middle Pleistocene. These various species displayed varying levels of adaptability related to their environments and diets: the early human ancestor Ardipithecus ramID is believed to be closely tied to forests; Sahelanthropus tchadensis may have been semi-aquatic or terrestrial depending upon its habitat availability at different times; Orrorin tugenesis had characteristics suggesting it might also inhabit forest regions as well being more suspensory adapted; Kenyanthopus platyops demonstrated advanced bipédalism while A. afarensis shared similarities between those fossils attributed both to Au. habilis/Au rudolfensis who were associated mainly with savannahs or grasslands areas where they likely used crudel tools for hunting animals and processing food resources efficiently enough so that these distinct groups could compete successfully together within diverse ecosystems without significantly challenging each other's survival niche overlap limitations despite having potentially overlapping ranges across Eastern Africa around ~5 –3 million years ago before eventually giving way predominantly only habiline lineage representatives left alive after ~ 4 million years old era.\n"
