However, the diversity of these species is limited compared to later periods, such as the early Pleistocene, when more distinct hominid species like Homo habilis, Homo erectus, and Homo sapiens (early modern humans) emerged. The data does not suggest that there was a single species with no diversity, a single dominant species, a great amount of species diversity, a prolonged ice age followed by a severe drought causing increased or decreased species diversity, decreased population numbers due to harsh climate conditions, or very little species diversity during this period. Regarding stone tool manufacture, it's also worth noting that there is evidence indicating increasing complexity and specialization in the production of hammerstones and flakes during the Middle Pliocene, according to some studies. However, it's important to emphasize that various interpretations exist, based on different sets of data and research perspectives.\n"

This is based on the discovery of various fossils such as Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and early Homo species. However, it's important to note that the exact picture of species diversity and distribution during this time is still evolving as new research continues. The idea of \"one dominant species\" or \"a single species with no diversity\" is not supported by current evidence. Furthermore, while some Middle Pliocene hominids were using stone tools, it would not be accurate to say that there was \"increased numbers of hammerstones and flakes, indicating stone tool manufacture\" during this entire period, as the use of tools was not ubiquitous among all hominid species. Similarly, claims about the relationship between climate conditions and species diversity would depend on the specific geographic region and hominid species under consideration.\n"
