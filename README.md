# NLP_exam
Here i am working on my exam project for NLP on the cogsci masters. I wan to develop steering vectors that can improve LLM uncertainty disclosure as natural language




# What is in here?
The files named ????? and ????? are the two files used for generating the results in the paper. Comments in the files explain what goes on. 
Essentially they are loading packages and defining and loading the model
generating content for the vectors
creating the vectors
generating baseline generations, calculating entropy
and generating steered versions

dialz_vector.pkl and ???vector.pkl are the two different steering vectors used in the work. Code for importing them is in the jupyter notebooks. They can also be generated an from teh code in the notebooks, but importing them saves a lot of computation.
